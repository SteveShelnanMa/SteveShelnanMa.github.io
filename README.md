I’m Xiaonan, or Steve. I earned my PhD in economics at the University of Rochester in May 2025. My research was supervised by Mark Bils.

Research Fields: Macroeconomics, Labor Economics, Firm Dynamics.

Using micro-level data, I am particularly interested in the worker and firm dynamics in the frictional labor market, and how their interactions shape the aggregate economy.
