I'm Xiaonan (pronouced [Hsiao-Nan](https://www.howtopronounce.com/hsiaonan#google_vignette)), or Steve. I am a PhD candidate in economics at the [University of Rochester](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/index.html).

My research falls into macroeconomics and labor economics, with special focus on the dynamics between workers and firms. I am particularly interested in exploring how these interactions influence the structure of the labor market and the broader economy. My Ph.D. research is supervised by [Mark Bils](https://sites.google.com/view/markbils/research).

## I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
