I'm Xiaonan (["Shee-ow-Nahn"](https://translate.google.com/?hl=zh-CN&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=潇南&op=translate)), or Steve. 
I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Rochester. My Ph.D. research is supervised by [Mark Bils](https://sites.google.com/view/markbils/research). I am on the 2024-2025 job market.

### Research Interets: Macroeconomics, Labor Market, Search and Matching. 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research combines empirical and quantitative methods, often leveraging micro-data to explore the dynamics between workers and firms in frictional labor markets. I investigate how these interactions influence macroeconomic outcomes.
