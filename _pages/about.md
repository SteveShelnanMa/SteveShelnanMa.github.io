I'm [Xiaonan](https://translate.google.com/?hl=zh-CN&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=潇南&op=translate), or Steve. 
I am a PhD candidate in economics at the [University of Rochester](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/index.html). My Ph.D. research is supervised by [Mark Bils](https://sites.google.com/view/markbils/research).


### Research Interets: Macroeconomics, Labor Market, Firm Dynamics. 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research combines reduced-form and structural analyses, leveraging micro-data to explore the dynamics between workers and firms in frictional labor markets. I investigate how these interactions influence macroeconomic outcomes.

### I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
