### Research Interets: Macroeconomics, Labor Market, Search and Matching. 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research combines empirical and quantitative methods, often leveraging micro-data to explore the dynamics between workers and firms in frictional labor markets. I investigate how these interactions influence macroeconomic outcomes.

### I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
